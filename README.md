# Truss Optimization
This repo was made as an extension to a school project from MTE 119: Statics. The goal of the project was to design a low-cost truss bridge that would support a train of given mass without
exceeding given maximum tension and compression forces within each member.

## Methodology
Our group experimented with a variety of methodologies for this project and finally settled on a numeric optimization problem: We would input a rough un-optimized shape for the bridge and
the program would optimize the joint positions to minimize the cost while maintaining the constraints. Other ideas we explored involved neural networks to design unique shapes to be 
optimized, but we deemed it out of the scope of this project.
